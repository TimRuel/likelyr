\title{Likelihood-Based Inference for a Calibrated Model}
\usage{
infer(cal, which = NULL, alpha_levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cal}{A \code{calibrated_model} produced by \code{calibrate()} and then
\code{integrate()} or \code{profile()}.}

\item{which}{Optional character vector naming entries in \code{cal$results}
to perform inference on. Defaults to all available likelihood results.}

\item{alpha_levels}{Optional numeric vector of α-levels
(e.g. \code{c(0.05, 0.1)}). If \code{NULL}, derived from the estimand specification.}
}
\value{
The same \code{calibrated_model}, augmented with inference results and
assigned the additional class \code{"likelyr_inferred"}.
}
\description{
Attaches likelihood-based inferential summaries—point estimates and
likelihood-ratio confidence intervals—to previously computed likelihood
results.

This function does \strong{not} recompute likelihoods. It operates on likelihood
objects (e.g. from \code{integrate()} or \code{profile()}) already stored in a
calibrated model.

For each selected likelihood result in \code{cal$results}, a
\code{"likelyr_inference"} object is attached at:

\preformatted{
  cal$results[[name]]$inference
}
}
\details{
If \code{alpha_levels} is \strong{NULL}, values are derived from the estimand
specification:

\preformatted{
  alpha_levels = 1 - estimand$confidence_levels
}

ensuring consistency between estimation and inference defaults.
}
