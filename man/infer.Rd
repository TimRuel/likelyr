\title{Likelihood-Based Inference for a Calibrated Model}
\usage{
infer(cal, which = NULL, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{cal}{A \code{calibrated_model} returned by \code{\link[=calibrate]{calibrate()}} and
subsequently by \code{\link[=integrate]{integrate()}} or \code{\link[=profile]{profile()}}.}

\item{which}{Optional character vector specifying which entries of
\code{cal$results} to infer on. Default: all likelihood results.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric vector of confidence levels (e.g. \code{0.05}).}
}
\value{
The \strong{same calibrated_model}, but with each selected result
updated to contain an \code{"inference"} object. The returned model gains
class \code{"likelyr_inferred"}.
}
\description{
Computes likelihood-based inferential quantities — MLEs, smoothed
likelihood curves, relative log-likelihood functions, and LR-based
confidence intervals — for one or more likelihood results stored
inside a \code{calibrated_model}.

This function \strong{modifies the calibrated model in place}, attaching
an inference object to each likelihood component under:

\preformatted{
  cal$results[[name]]$inference
}

The updated calibrated model is returned, with class
\code{"likelyr_inferred"} added via \code{\link[=mark_inferred]{mark_inferred()}}.
}
\details{
A calibrated model may contain:
\itemize{
\item Integrated likelihood results (\code{"IL"})
\item Profile likelihood results (\code{"PL"})
\item Other likelihood-based outputs
}

For each selected result, \code{infer()} generates:
\itemize{
\item Spline-smoothed likelihood curve
\item MLE and maximum log-likelihood
\item Relative log-likelihood function rLL(ψ)
\item Likelihood-ratio confidence intervals
}
}
