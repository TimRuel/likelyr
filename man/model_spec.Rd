\description{
Declares:
• likelihood_spec()  (required before calibration)
• estimand_spec()    (required before calibration)
• nuisance_spec()    (required before calibration)
• optimizer_spec()   (required before integrate/profile)
• execution_spec()   (required before integrate/profile)

Structural specs must be present before calibration. Execution specs
may be added later.
