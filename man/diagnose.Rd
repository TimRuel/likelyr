\usage{
diagnose(cal, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cal}{A \code{calibrated_model} that has undergone integrate() or
profile().}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print diagnostic summaries.}
}
\value{
The same calibrated model, with class \code{"likelyr_diagnosed"}
and diagnostics added to each result.
}
\description{
Scans all entries of \code{cal$results}, attaching a diagnostics object to
each likelihood result (Integrated or Profile). Integrated Likelihood
(IL) receives full Monte Carlo diagnostics; Profile Likelihood (PL)
receives a placeholder for now.

Diagnostics are stored under:
\preformatted{
  cal$results[[name]]$diagnostics
}
}
