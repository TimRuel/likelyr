\title{Compare Integrated and Profile Likelihood Inference}
\usage{
compare(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A calibrated model specification.}
}
\value{
The input object with a comparison result attached.
}
\description{
Orchestrates comparison between profile likelihood (PL) and
integrated likelihood (IL) inference results for a calibrated
model specification.

The input must already have:
• been calibrated via \code{\link[=calibrate]{calibrate()}}
• had both \code{\link[=profile]{profile()}} and \code{\link[=integrate]{integrate()}} applied
• had \code{\link[=infer]{infer()}} run on \emph{both} likelihood components

The result is the same calibrated model spec, augmented with a
comparison object of class \code{"likelyr_comparison"}.
