\title{Average Branches (Monte Carlo Integrated Likelihood)}
\usage{
average_branches(branches)
}
\arguments{
\item{branches}{A list of data.frames, each with columns \code{psi} and \code{value}
where \code{value} is log-likelihood evaluated at that psi.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns \code{psi} and \code{value} (integrated LL on log scale)
}
\description{
Computes the Monte Carlo estimate of the integrated likelihood by
averaging exponentiated branch log-likelihoods and returning results
on the log scale using a numerically stable log-sum-exp operation.
