\title{Calibrate a model_spec to data}
\usage{
calibrate(model, data, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{model_spec} object.}

\item{data}{User data.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print calibration diagnostics.
Defaults to FALSE for pipe-friendly behavior.}
}
\value{
A \code{calibrated_model} object.
}
\description{
Prepares a model for computing profile or integrated likelihoods.
Calibration is modular: each structural component (likelihood,
estimand, nuisance) is processed by its own calibration helper.

Optimizer and execution specs are \emph{not required at calibration time}.
They may be supplied later and are validated by integrate()/profile().
